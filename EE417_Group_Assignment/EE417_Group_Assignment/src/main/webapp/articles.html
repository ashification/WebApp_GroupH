                    <h1>Jose Mourinho, from game one to game 1000</h1>
                    <p>History was made with Roma’s 2-1 win against Sassuolo at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday night.<br>
                        In an extremely entertaining and end-to-end game, Jose Mourinho’s Roma managed to beat a plucky 
                        Sassuolo.<br> The result was largely down to the goalkeeping heroics of Rui Patricio, 
                        a well-worked free-kick routine from Lorenzo Pellegrini and Bryan Cristante, and Stephan El Shaarawy’s clinical 91st-minute winner.<br>
                        While securing the three points was important for Roma’s title charge, it was more significant for Mourinho: it was the Portuguese’s 1,000th game in charge.<br>

                    <p>Welcome to the NFL 100, The Athletic’s endeavor to identify the 100 best players in football history. Today, the two-month-long project reaches its conclusion as we crown the No. 1 player.<br>
                        Julian Edelman had never seen the board.<br>
                        During the 2013 offseason, he uncovered Tom Brady’s greatest source of motivation. The teammates had been working out together in Los Angeles when Edelman saw a prominently displayed whiteboard in Brady’s home gym, scripted with a sole objective.<br>
